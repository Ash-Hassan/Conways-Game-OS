## Approach ##
First i learn the rules of the game then i googled some source code and found 1 of c# from geeksforgeeks but that was method based and hardcoded.
so i eventually converted the syntax in c and run it after that i loaded array from file by using FILE and its functions..
then i made single threadfunction and put the nextgeneration code in it.
the output was saved in a file and every generation output was appended in file.
finally i calculated the time by using <time.h> library and saved that too in the file at the end.

## Problems Faces ##

### Problem 1: I don't know how the game works(rules)###
Got the idea from GeaksforGeeks.

### Problem 2: Threadfunction was hard as it dosnt ake multiple arguments ###
Made many variables gloabl so that they dosent required to be passed and passed the Needed one only.

### Problem 3: Time Constarint as i started the project a day before deadline ###
working late at night :)
